I've known Zach for almost 10 years now, we actually met when I was in 8th grade, though I think he was already in college then. Zach is a very upbeat person who loves talking to people and sharing experiences. When he approached me and let me know he wanted a website, I was excited to build him one that would really bolster his personal brand and just have it be a place he could proudly show people and get more leads for his dance clinics.

I used Materialize CSS framework, though very minimally. Most of the CSS is done by hand and just follows good responsive design practices.

One of the unfortunately more hacky parts of the project so far is the image gallery. I pulled it from http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/ and apparently it's supposed to be the entire website.. but it also makes for a beautiful image gallery. Unfortunately they had their CSS, JS, and HTML coupled so tightly together it was proving really hard to seperate it out so I just put it in an iframe. That's the "supersized" stuff you see in the CSS and JS folders as well as the reason we have a theme folder.
