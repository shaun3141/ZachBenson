            <div id="referenceContainer">
                <div class="referenceContent">Zach came to teach workshops at my school in Phnom Penh in 2015, his classes were jam packed of local and expatriate dancers all wanting to learn how to dance as well as he does! He really cared about each dancer in the room on an individual level. Zach gave advice to our dancers also on audition processes and what judges on shows like SYTYCD are looking for. We all really had a great time, and I would book him again to dance with us in a heartbeat.
